# Binance technical task.

As it is Proof of Concept I made a fork from my own react-starter-kit

## Run project:
1. Install all dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run `yarn dev` for development or `yarn build && yarn start` for production build
3. Navigate your browser to (app)[http://localhost:3000/]


## Unit tests:
Run `yarn test:watch` for development or `yarn test` for ordinary run.


## Healthcheck
Run `yarn healthcheck` to check if no Typescript / EsLint errors, code style / commit names are fine, unit tests pass, production build is compiled.
